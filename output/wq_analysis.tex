\subsection{EXECUTIVE SUMMARY}\label{executive-summary}}

Miami Waterkeeper was contracted by the City of Fort Lauderdale to
conduct waterway quality monitoring at ten high-value recreational sites
for the last two years (January 2021- December 2022). The data is
rapidly made available to the residents and visitors of the City of Fort
Lauderdale through the online app -Swim Guide, social media and the
Miami Waterkeeper website so they can make informed decisions about the
potential health risks of the water within recreational areas.

Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), including enterococci, are measured in
water bodies to determine whether there are potential pathogens present
that may be harmful to human health. High amounts of enterococci at a
site can indicate a nearby source of FIB (from stormwater runoff, septic
tanks, sewage leaks, etc). Enterococci can come from various fecal
sources, including human sewage, dogs, birds, wildlife, etc. While
enterococci is an excellent metric for health-related waterway quality,
its presence is more like a symptom of a deeper issue, which is why
monitoring it is vital. When the enterococci levels exceed a certain
threshold (70+ CPU/MPN per 100 mL), the Florida Department of Health
(DOH) advises that contact with the water may pose an increased health
risk.

The data collected from two years of waterway quality monitoring around
the City of Fort Lauderdale has allowed us to better understand the
water quality trends at each site. Annually, 39\% of the weekly samples
we collected had exceeded the DOH recommended threshold for safe
recreational usage. Of the ten sites, four sites stood out as locations
with persistent water quality issues, including Sweeting Park,
Himmarshee Canal, Tarpon River, and Annie Beck Park.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Samples from Sweeting Park have consistently exceeded the standard
  about 97\% of the time and has shown no improvements in water quality
  since 2021. Monitoring has allowed us to measure this trend, but the
  FIB source is unclear. The City has conducted smoke testing in the
  North Fork basin to identify potential leaks in the sanitary sewer
  system. However, a homeless encampment nearby continues to be a
  potential source of concern as well as abundant wildlife. Further
  investigation is recommended. While the compliance rate with the
  highly conservative FDOH standard has not improved, the number of
  exceedances over 1000 MPN has been reduced from 10 incidences in 2021
  to half that in 2022. While this does not speak to potential impacts
  to human health, it does address potential source reduction in inputs
  over time.
\item
  There was a reduction in the number of exceedances at Himmarshee Canal
  and Tarpon River. The average enterococci concentration has been
  increasing over time in the Himmarshee Canal and decreasing at Tarpon
  River. The source of the enterococci could be potentially related to
  stormwater discharge or infrastructure malfunctions, but further
  investigation is recommended. Monitoring these sites during waterway
  quality improvement initiatives, like dredging, is crucial to capture
  quantifiable changes in FIB as a metric of efficacy.
\item
  Annie Beck Park has shown an increasing trend in enterococci
  concentrations over the last 2 years. Monitoring has allowed us to
  identify this increasing trend. A leaking sewer pipe under a nearby
  bridge was identified in late December, 2022 which may have
  contributed to the increased bacterial count at Annie Beck prior to
  its repair. Further investigation is recommended to ensure efficacy of
  infrastructure repairs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{INTRODUCTION}\label{introduction}}

Visiting a beach or waterway is the number one activity of Florida's
tourists, undeniably the biggest draw for the state's \$112 billion
annual tourism revenue. Almost half a million people are directly
employed in Florida's ocean economy. Florida's tourism industry, job
market, recreation, environment, and even Florida's culture depends on
having clean waterways.

South Florida's waterways are also particularly vulnerable to pollution
because of our low elevation, porous limestone geology, aging
infrastructure, and the threat of sea-level rise. Without clean
waterways, our ocean economy, job market, recreation, environment, and
culture are all at risk. If we don't protect our waterways, we risk
jeopardizing our coastal community and environment for all future
generations.

The City of Fort Lauderdale hosts a thriving community fueled by
tourism, recreation, and real estate. The recreational use of waterways
is valuable to the Fort Lauderdale community; however, despite its
importance to the community, relatively little data about waterway
quality was readily available to the residents or visitors who use the
waterways for recreation. While the Florida Department of Health (DOH)
monitors for Fecal Indicator Bacteria (FIB), the data is hard to find
and only focuses on beaches rather than inland waterways such as canals,
rivers, or lakes. While there is a higher potential for ingestion of the
bacteria while swimming at the beach, the canals and rivers are often
used by residents and visitors who enjoy kayaking, paddle boarding,
canoeing, and other recreational watersports.

Miami Waterkeeper has addressed these gaps over the last two years
through a contract with the City of Fort Lauderdale. Our weekly waterway
quality monitoring program emulates the DOH methodology and frequency
for ten inland waterways for which publicly accessible waterway quality
data is a necessity. Miami Waterkeeper makes the FIB data available to
the public as soon as it is available, along with the DOH data, through
the Swim Guide app and social media so that residents and visitors can
make informed decisions before interacting with the inland waterways in
the City of Fort Lauderdale.

Waterway quality issues may seriously impact the health of those who
come in contact with recreational water. It is important to many
concerned residents and visitors of the City of Fort Lauderdale to have
access to relevant waterway quality data to ensure they are informed
about potential health risks before interacting with the water at
recreational areas. Waterway quality threats, including Sanitary Sewage
Overflows (SSOs) which can cause temporary FIB impairments, are being
addressed by the City of Fort Lauderdale and have been reduced over the
last few years due to the infrastructure investments.

With information about waterway quality from the same locations taken
over time, we can gather baseline data about conditions and inform the
public about changes in waterway quality. This report summarizes data
collected during two years of weekly sampling at ten sites in the City
of Fort Lauderdale.

\hypertarget{about-miami-waterkeeper}{%
\subsection{ABOUT MIAMI WATERKEEPER}\label{about-miami-waterkeeper}}

As a Miami-based non-profit organization, Miami Waterkeeper is dedicated
to protecting South Florida's coastal waters and the surrounding
watershed. Launched in 2010, Miami Waterkeeper has become a leading
advocate for clean water, inspiring a movement of empowered citizens
dedicated to achieving swimmable, drinkable, fishable water. Often
tackling issues on multiple fronts, we address environmental, social,
and policy water issues using community outreach, scientific research,
and civic and legal action.

Miami Waterkeeper defends the public's right to use and enjoy clean
water by focusing on clean water, ecosystem protection, and sea-level
rise readiness in South Florida.

Miami Waterkeeper's jurisdiction spans a watershed that serves more than
five (5) million people across Miami-Dade and Broward counties and
encompasses the mid-section of the Florida Reef Tract. As part of our
science and research platform, our water quality monitoring program
samples 27 locations weekly in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties to
determine the level of the fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) enterococci
and the safety of the waterways for swimming or other activities and
immediately share the results with the public.

\hypertarget{about-this-program}{%
\subsection{ABOUT THIS PROGRAM}\label{about-this-program}}

The City of Fort Lauderdale initially contracted with Miami Waterkeeper
on November 13, 2020, to expand waterway quality monitoring to inland
waterways, focusing on areas of high recreational value. The annual
contract was renewed to include sampling throughout 2022, and we are
currently in the process of renewing a multi-year contract.

At the ten weekly sampling sites, samples for the analysis of the fecal
indicator bacteria (FIB) enterococci were collected, along with
parameters such as dissolved oxygen (DO), chlorophyll a, salinity,
turbidity, and temperature. Sample collection, processing, and analyses
were performed under protocols similar to that of the Florida Department
of Health (DOH)'s Florida Healthy Beaches Program. The DOH sets the
threshold of FIB at 70 MPN for public recreation; levels greater than 70
MPN indicate possible risks to human health. Miami Waterkeeper collected
samples from an exceeding site a second time in the same week, referred
to as a ``resample.''

The aims of the contract were to:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Provide weekly waterway quality monitoring at ten City of Fort
  Lauderdale sites
\item
  Provide a baseline understanding of FIB in local waterways
\item
  Inform the local community about waterway quality monitoring results
\end{itemize}

Per our original proposal, we conducted the following waterway quality
monitoring tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Weekly sampling at four designated Watersport Activity Areas and six
  outside Designated Wastersports Activity Areas or of general interest.
\item
  Swim Guide app development and City of Fort Lauderdale Banner Ads
\end{enumerate}

We publish our weekly waterway quality testing information along with
the water quality testing information produced by the state DOH for
Broward County beaches via the Swim Guide Application, our social media
channels, and on our website www.miamiwaterkeeper.org/water\_monitoring.
Numeric data are also available for the public to download on our
website.

The Swim Guide app is available on both web and mobile devices. The app
had 22,161 views from January 2021- December 2022, at the City of Fort
Lauderdale sponsored sites (10,652 in 2022).

The app utilizes an easy-to-read format, with green indicating good
water quality (0-70 CFU/MPN enterococci per 100 mL sample) and red
indicating poor water quality (71+ CFU/MPN enterococci per 100 mL
sample). Historical data is also accessible. All of our weekly
monitoring sites and the most recent results are available to the public
for easy access.

A banner ad is included on the Swim Guide pages of the funded sites The
City of Fort Lauderdale's banner ads have been featured on the pages for
all ten Fort Lauderdale sites since January 2021.

\emph{Site Descriptions:}

Ten locations in the City of Fort Lauderdale were selected in
coordination with the Public Works Department (Figure 1). These
included:

Annie Beck Park is approximately 2.4 acres in the Victoria Park
neighborhood. It is next to the Rio Navarro canal. It offers amenities
like nature trails, open areas, and a waterfront suitable for kayak
launching. Slow flow, organic film/biofilm on the water's surface, and
floating leaves and vegetation are frequently noted at this site.

Coontie Hatchee Park (South Fork of the New River)is approximately 2.6
acres along the South Fork of the New River and has amenities such as a
kayak/canoe launch, waterfront views, bicycle racks, fitness trail with
stations, picnic tables, and pavilions. Foam on the water's surface,
floating vegetation, and some trash are noted at this site.

Himmarshee Canal was a tributary of the New River, historically a major
artery in and out of the Everglades. The word translates to ``new
water'' or ``new river.'' The Himmarshee Canal now starts near
US1/Federal Highway and traverses the neighborhoods of Colee Hammock and
Beverly Heights as it flows under Las Olas Blvd and out to the New
River. Floating vegetation, foam/organic film on the water's surface,
and slow flow are frequently noted at this site.

Lake Sylvia (Designated Watersports Activity Area) is suitable for water
skiing, tubing, kneeboarding, and wakeboarding. Lake Sylvia is within
the Harbor Beach neighborhood. Water is often noted as clear. Middle
River at George English Park (Designated Watersports Activity Area) is
suitable for water skiing, tubing, kneeboarding, and wakeboarding.
George English Park is approximately 19.7 acres and offers such
amenities as kayaking, paddle boarding, fishing, boat access/ramp, and
walking/jogging trails. Water is often noted as clear.

Royal Palm Drive at Las Olas Boulevard is within the Nurmi Isles
neighborhood north of Las Olas Blvd. A smell of sewage is occasionally
noted at this site but is inconsistent. Water is often noted as clear
with occasional floating vegetation.

Sand Bar (Designated Watersports Activity Area) at SE 10th Street is
suitable for water skiing, tubing, kneeboarding, and wakeboarding. It is
also a popular area for boaters to moor and enjoy the water. Water is
often noted as clear.

Sunrise Bay at Hugh Taylor Birch State Park (Designated Watersports
Activity Area) is suitable for water skiing, tubing, kneeboarding, and
wakeboarding. Sunrise Bay is within the Coral Ridge neighborhood and is
adjacent to Hugh Taylor Birch State Park. Hugh Taylor Birch is the
city's own ``Central Park,'' complete with gopher tortoises and boat
access from the Intracoastal waterway. Water is observed to be brown
with occasional floating vegetation.

Sweeting Park (North Fork of the New River) is approximately 0.3 acres
along the North Fork of the New River and has amenities such as fishing,
a dock, and park benches. The site has slow- moving water, frequently
has biofilm or other organic material on the surface along with
vegetation, and the river floor appears to be silty with fine sediment
particles under normal conditions.

Tarpon River at Rio Vista Boulevard intersects with the New River at two
locations, SW 8th Ave and Ponce De Leon Drive. The Tarpon River
traverses the neighborhoods of Tarpon River, Downtown Fort Lauderdale,
and Rio Vista. Along the way, at SW 11th Street, is the Tarpon Cove
Park, with amenities such as fishing and water frontage. Floating
vegetation, brown water, foam/biofilm on the surface, and construction
has been noted at this site.

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\subsection{METHODS}\label{methods}}

This monitoring program implements Miami Waterkeeper's fecal indicator
bacteria (FIB) monitoring protocols to include ten sites of high
recreational value in the City of Fort Lauderdale. Sample collection
occurs weekly, along with resampling and reanalysis, when the threshold
of 70 MPN is exceeded.

Miami Waterkeeper uses the IDEXX system for routine sampling collection
and enumeration of the FIB enterococci present in water quality samples.
The IDEXX system only presents results as whole numbers. Prior to
collecting samples, precautions are taken to ensure that sampling
bottles are sterile; this includes using an autoclave to sanitize the
bottles of any bacteria or impurities with heat and pressure. Gloves are
always used when handling the samples so they do not become contaminated
with bacteria. Samples are collected approximately 6-12 inches below the
surface to best capture conditions where recreational activities take
place. The samples were collected without making contact with the bottom
or stirring up sediment. Samples were collected facing the oncoming
current so as not to contaminate the sample with the sample collector's
bacteria or sediment put into suspension. Samples are immediately
(within 15 min of collection) placed on ice for preservation.

IDEXX trays containing the water sample and the IDEXX enterolert reagent
are placed in an incubator for 24-28 hours and then analyzed under UV
light for the Most Probable Number (MPN).

Sample collection, processing, and analysis protocols are based on the
EPA Method 1600 protocol and the Florida Department of Health (DOH)
standards for enterococci. The field technicians include recent
graduates and students from local universities who are trained in
collecting field samples, sample processing, and laboratory analyses.

\emph{Enterococci Criteria}

The following are the EPA-recommended enterococci thresholds that the
DOH uses to determine quality of the water.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  0-35 MPN/CFU enterococci per 100 mL sample: Good
\item
  36 -- 70 MPN/CFU enterococci per 100 mL sample: Moderate
\item
  71+ MPN/CFU enterococci per 100 mL sample: Poor
\end{itemize}

Swim Guide utilizes an easy-to-read format, with green indicating
``good'' water quality and red indicating ``poor'' water quality.
Enterococci results that fall within the ``moderate'' range are reported
as ``good'' on Swim Guide.

\emph{Field Collections and Sample Handling Quality Control}

With each sampling batch, a site is selected at random to be collected a
second time as a field replicate. The results are analyzed to evaluate
the field collection and sample handling techniques. Field technicians
are audited in the first month of independent sampling. After the
initial audit, they are then audited every six months. Technicians may
also be randomly audited at any time. Images of the site are also taken
with each sample.

In 2022, we implemented a new quality control measure that allows the
laboratory staff to verify that samples were appropriately preserved on
ice throughout the sampling process (under 6°C). This is accomplished
using a Temperature control bottle, which is placed in each cooler at
the beginning of the sampling process and then measured with a
thermometer when the field technicians reach the lab.

\emph{Laboratory Quality Control}

With each analytical batch, a sample selected at random is collected and
analyzed in duplicate. Every batch also includes a laboratory blank,
which is analyzed to evaluate the aseptic technique, laboratory
sanitation practices, and laboratory equipment's sterility. Laboratory
technicians are audited in the first month of independent analysis.
After the initial audit, they are then audited every six months.
Technicians may also be randomly audited at any time. Images of each
IDEXX tray are also taken when samples are under UV light and analyzed.

\emph{Environmental Data}

We also collected waterway quality data on environmental conditions at
the time of samplings, such as weather, tide, temperature, and rainfall.
Our field technicians make weather observations on site, determining
whether conditions at the time of sample collections are sunny, cloudy,
or rainy; we also determine the direction of the current (right to left,
left to right, straight toward, or still). Our wind speed and air
temperature data are taken from the NavClock app, which pulls from
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather sites.
Rainfall and tide are taken from the NOAA National Centers for
Environmental Information (NCEI) database.

\emph{Documentation and Data Management}

Data is recorded on a data sheet and then entered manually into a master
spreadsheet housed on Google Drive by a technician. All data entered is
audited and analyzed by the Water Quality Research Manager for quality
assurance and accuracy. Scans of the data sheets and images from the
field and laboratory quality control protocols are stored in Google
Drive. After samples are analyzed, the Water Quality Research Manager
reviews and then publishes the exceedance results on Swim Guide.

\emph{Methods for Analysis}

Two sets of analyses were performed. The first set was a descriptive
statistics evaluation of the entire period of study for the ten City of
Fort Lauderdale sites. Then an ANOVA and linear regression model were
performed from the time period of the contract with the City of Fort
Lauderdale.
